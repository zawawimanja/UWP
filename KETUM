a) Using this is good because it is static

  public static ObservableCollection<Employee> GetEmployees(){
  var employees = new ObservableCollection<Employee>();
  }
            

if listview contain 

x:Name="MyList" then
MyList.ItemsSource = Employee.GetEmployees();
.GetEmployees() is object observable.

0r 

public ObservableCollection<Student> stdlist = new ObservableCollection<Student>();

MyList.ItemsSource = stdlist;
stdlist is object observable 

b)

if listview contain 

x:Name="MyList" then
 GetEmployees();
.GetEmployees() is method that contain object observable .

c)

 public static List<Book> GetBooks()


  Books is list =  private List<Book> Books;
  so GetBooks() also need to convert to list  public static List<Book> GetBooks()
  but this is not using observable meethod
 
   Books = BookManager.GetBooks();
   
   
  d)
      public static Employee GetEmployee()
   
       GeEmployee is normal method. Not contain list or object observable
       DataContext = Employee.GetEmployee(); 
       
       OR
       
       Person person= new Person() is oobject
       this.DataContext = person;
